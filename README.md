# CountdownTimer
Created Folders and Files
Started with putting the COuntdown counter of w3School in the javascript
Set up the HTML side
insert two buttons
insert set date module
creating an id for the buttons and module
trying to change the java script so i can add the buttons to java scriptglobal variables that every function can access 
new to do list.
Start Timer
TODO: Recognize a button click w event listener
TODO: Make sure the countdown information, is accessable here 
Stop Timer
getting information on how to implement 
stop button working
start button work but howefer it is not stopping again....
the form i would like to implement what i think is to get the form date
and implement em in a array to the countdown time set date.
so when you would press start button it would take from the array the 1 string so the 0 would be the actual date that needs to be update 
with a pop....
as i see time is running out so.
i focus now on design and make sure its nice..
as i try around i was able to fix the start and stop button
with changing the var x to x.
now i will try to implement the date of the form to the new time by the countdown.
with the new button.
Also mad a splash button to change the toggle background.
